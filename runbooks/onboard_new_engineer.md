# Onboard New Engineer
When a new engineer starts at Transposit, there are several accounts and configurations that need to be updated.

## Create an Email Address
[Create Email Address](https://console.transposit.com/mc/t/transposit/actions/create_transposit_email)

- Transposit uses Google's G-Suite for e-mail and shared documents. 
One of the most important things is to create the engineer's email address, but it doesn't look like this is something that can be automated yet.

- The username chosen for the email address will be re-used as the new employee's account name for other services

Some things to keep in mind:

- *Due to length restrictions, it is best if the main account is 8 characters or less if possible*

- *At the current time, it's recommended to use the employee's first name*

- _At some point in the future, this may change due to company size and availability_


## Add Email Aliases if Applicable
[Create Email Alias](https://console.transposit.com/mc/t/transposit/actions/add_transposit_email_alias)
- The new employee might ask to create an email alias such as first initial, last name - or a nickname

- For example, `josh@transposit.com` could be the main account, with `jfraser@transposit.com` and `jfray@transposit.com` as aliases

## Google Groups
