# Onboard New Engineer
* When a new engineer starts at Transposit, there are several accounts and configurations that need to be updated.

## Create an Email Address
* One of the most important things is to [create a new email address](https://app.transposit.com/mc/t/transposit/actions/create_transposit_email)
* The username chosen for the email address will be re-used as the new employee's account name for other services
* Due to length restrictions, it is best if the main account is 8 characters or less if possible
* At the current time, it's recommended to use the employee's first name
* * At some point in the future, this may change due to company size and availability.

### Add Email Aliases if Applicable
* The new employee might ask to [create an alias](https://www.transposit.com), such as first initial, last name - or a nickname
* For example, `josh@transposit.com` could be the main account, with `jfraser@transposit.com` and `jfray@transposit.com` as aliases

## HR Tasks
* The HR representative will have the new employee fill out their employment and benefits paperwork
* Using the email address previously created, [invite the employee to Ease](https://www.transposit.com)
* * [Invite employee to other sites](https://www.transposit.com) here as applicable 

## Create AWS User
* Using the username from the email step, [create an IAM user](https://www.transposit.com)
* Provide the username to `SRE` so that they can run the `sandbox` management script
* * Documentation for `sandbox` usage will be sent as part of the `Confluence Access` step 

## GitHub Repository Access
* If the employee already has an active `GitHub` account they would like to use, [add that user](https://www.transposit.com) to the `Transposit` organization
* * If the employee does not have an active `GitHub` account, [create one](https://www.transposit.com) for them
* [Add the employee to the appropriate groups](https://www.transposit.com) for necessary permissions

* [Provide links](https://www.transposit.com) to machine setup, company values, OpsGenie notification setup, Accessing AWS / Sandbox
* [Assign a Jira ticket](https://www.transposit.com) to the employee to track machine setup and other questions
