# Onboard New Engineer
* When a new engineer starts at Transposit, there are several accounts and configurations that need to be updated.

## Create an Email Address
* One of the most important things is to create a new email address
* The username chosen for the email address will be re-used as the new employee's account name for other services
* Due to length restrictions, it is best if the main account is 8 characters or less if possible
* At the current time, it's recommended to use the employee's first name
* * At some point in the future, this may change due to company size and availability.

### Add Email Aliases if Applicable
* The new employee might ask for an alias, such as first initial, last name - or a nickname
* For example, `josh@transposit.com` could be the main account, with `jfraser@transposit.com` and `jfray@transposit.com` as aliases

## Create AWS User
