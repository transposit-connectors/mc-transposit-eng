# Onboard New Engineer
* When a new engineer starts at Transposit, there are several accounts and configurations that need to be updated.

## Create an Email Address
* [Transposit](https://www.transposit.com) uses [Google's G-Suite](https://gsuite.google.com/intl/en_ca/) for e-mail and shared documents
* One of the most important things is to [create a new email address](https://console.transposit.com/mc/t/transposit/actions/create_transposit_email)
* * Doesn't look like this is something that can be automated yet. Still looking.
* The username chosen for the email address will be re-used as the new employee's account name for other services
* Due to length restrictions, it is best if the main account is 8 characters or less if possible
* At the current time, it's recommended to use the employee's first name
* * At some point in the future, this may change due to company size and availability.

### Add Email Aliases if Applicable
* The new employee might ask to [create an alias](https://www.transposit.com), such as first initial, last name - or a nickname
* For example, `josh@transposit.com` could be the main account, with `jfraser@transposit.com` and `jfray@transposit.com` as aliases

## Google Groups
* [Transposit](https://www.transposit.com) uses [Google Groups](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9304805?hl=en) for distribution lists, with the added benefit of searching archived threads
* * [Invite] the new employee to the appropriate [Google Groups](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9304805?hl=en)

## HR Tasks
* [Transposit](https://www.transposit.com) uses [Ease](https://www.ease.com) to manage benefits, discretionary time off, and other HR-related functions
* * Using the email address previously created, [invite the employee to Ease](https://www.transposit.com)
* The [HR representative](mailto:hr@transposit.com) will have the new employee fill out their employment and benefits paperwork

## Create AWS IAM User
* [Transposit](https://www.transposit.com) is hosted by [Amazon Web Services / AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)
* Each engineer is provided an AWS user, which is managed by their [Identity and Access Management / IAM](https://www.amazonaws.cn/en/iam/) service
* * Using the username from the email step, [create an IAM user](https://www.transposit.com)
* Each engineer is provided an [AWS development sandbox](https://transposit.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEV/pages/310706177/Sandbox+AWS+Accounts) to develop, test, and deploy code
* * Provide the username to [SRE](mailto:sre@transposit.com) so that they can run the `sre-scripts/sandbox.py` management script

## GitHub Repository Access
* [Transposit](https://www.transposit.com) uses [GitHub](https://www.github.com) for `source code management / SCM`
* * If the employee already has an active [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account they would like to use, [add that user](https://www.transposit.com) to the [Transposit](https://www.github.com/transposit) organization
* * * If the employee does not have an active [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account, [create one](https://www.transposit.com) for them
* * [Add the employee to the appropriate groups](https://www.transposit.com) for necessary permissions

## Slack Access
* [Transposit](https://www.transposit.com) uses [Slack](https://www.slack.com) for team communication
* * Using the email address previously created, [invite the employee](https://www.transposit.com) to [Slack](https://www.slack.com)
* * [Add the employee](https://www.transposit.com) to appropriate [Slack](https://www.slack.com) channels

## Confluence and Jira Access
* Using the email address previously created, [invite the employee to Confluence and Jira](https://www.transposit.com)
* [Provide links](https://www.transposit.com) to machine setup, company values, OpsGenie notification setup, Accessing AWS / Sandbox
* [Assign a Jira ticket](https://www.transposit.com) to the employee to track machine setup and other questions
* * This validates that the new employee can interact with the ticketing system
* * It also allows us to track their onboarding progress

## OpsGenie
* Using the email address prevoiusly created, [invite the employee to OpsGenie](https://www.transposit.com)
* * Also [send a link to download the OpsGenie mobile application](https://www.transposit.com)
* [Send a test notification](https://www.transposit.com) to make sure the employee has configured their application correctly
