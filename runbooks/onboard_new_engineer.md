# Onboard New Engineer
* When a new engineer starts at Transposit, there are several accounts and configurations that need to be updated.

## Create an Email Address
* One of the most important things is to create a new email address
* The username chosen for the email address will be re-used as the new employee's account name for other services
* Due to length restrictions, it is best if the main account is 8 characters or less if possible
* At the current time, it's recommended to use the employee's first name
* * At some point in the future, this may change due to company size and availability.

### Add Email Aliases if Applicable
* The new employee might ask for an alias, such as first initial, last name - or a nickname
* For example, `josh@transposit.com` could be the main account, with `jfraser@transposit.com` and `jfray@transposit.com` as aliases

## HR Tasks
* The HR representative will have the new employee fill out their employment and benefits paperwork
* Using the email address previously created, invite the employee to `Ease`
* * Add other sites here as applicable 

## Create AWS User
* Using the username from the email step, create an `IAM` user
* Provide the username to `SRE` so that they can run the `sandbox` management script
* * Documentation for `sandbox` usage will be sent as part of the `Confluence Access` step 

## GitHub Repository Access
* If the employee already has an active `GitHub` account they would like to use, add that user to the `Transposit` organization
* * If the employee does not have an active `GitHub` account, create one for them
* Add the employee to the appropriate groups for necessary permissions

## Slack Access
* Using the email address previously created, invite the employee to `Slack`
* Add the employee to appropriate `Slack` channels

## Confluence and Jira Access
* Using the email address previously created, invite the employee to `Confluence` and `Jira`
* Provide links to machine setup, company values, OpsGenie notification setup, Accessing AWS / Sandbox
* Assign a `Jira` ticket to the employee to track machine setup and other questions
* * This validates that the new employee can interact with the ticketing system
* * It also allows us to track their onboarding progress

## OpsGenie
* Using the email address prevoiusly created, invite the employee to OpsGenie
* * Also send a link to download the OpsGenie mobile application.
* Send a test notification to make sure the employee has configured their application correctly
